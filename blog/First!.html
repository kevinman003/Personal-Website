        <p id="post"> Hi everybody, I'm Kevin Liang. For my life story, check out the about page, but this post is mainly for why I set up this website in the first place.
I have always dabbled around with computers here and there but only recently have I picked up programming. In middle school, my friend's dad introduced him to Small Basic,
one of perhaps the less popular programming languages. He brought the idea up to me and I loved programming from the start, mainly because of its ability to control computers
in a precise way, with nothing more and nothing less than you command it. Fast forward to high school, I took a programming class with a teacher that had less than satisfactory
student opinion. I took Computer Programming 1 with that teacher and loved the way to manipulate computers, but from then on, I self-taught the rest of my coding skills and
have loved doing it ever since.</p>
